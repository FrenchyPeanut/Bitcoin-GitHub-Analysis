# Bitcoin-GitHub-Analysis
*Analysis of the Bitcoin Open source project though GitHub Archive data*

In ten years of existence, Bitcoin proved to be the most successful cryptographic
currency in the history. Originally created by Satoshi Nakamoto,
first as a WhitePaper in 2008, followed quickly by the source-code of the
original software in 2009. The Bitcoin software is completely open-source
and is the first fully decentralized peer-to-peer version of electronic cash
system that is not controlled by any central authority or control point that
could be compromised. By using GitHub archive of data, we quantify aspects
of developer participation, community growth and internal issues
for this OSS project. We then use the price of the Bitcoin token to correlate
and reveal some important patterns that may indicate new behaviors in
the OSS community. We conclude that a new economy got created in the
OSS community by the issuing of crypto-currency that get real-world value
from its core and volunteer work.
